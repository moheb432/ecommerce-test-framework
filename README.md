# API Test Execution Report

**Summary:** 18 out of 26 test cases passed, 8 failed.

| Bug ID | Description                                           | Steps to Reproduce                                       | Expected Result                        | Actual Result                                     | Severity |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| BUG-001 | API accepts negative numbers in `productPrice`       | Send POST request with `productPrice = -500`           | API should reject negative prices      | API accepts negative price                        | High     |
| BUG-002 | API accepts empty `productFor` field                | Send POST request with `productFor = ""`               | API should require a valid value       | API accepts empty value                           | Medium   |
| BUG-003 | API accepts special characters in `productCategory` | Send POST request with `productCategory = "@Fashion!"` | API should reject special characters   | API accepts special characters                     | Medium   |

All test cases were executed **twice**:  
1. **Manual execution** using Postman  
2. **Automated execution** using Rest Assured
 
# Postman testing using the Testcases_csv_data
In **Postman**, all test cases were executed using a **CSV file** to supply test data.  
At least **10 different data sets** were used for execution.
on runing more than 14 iteration on the 25 testcase written above it was noticed that 
1. **Adding product takes more than 2secs to run
2. **the Api is careless about Both productCategory and ProductFor case if both of them special character or empty
3. the -ve price may be added on the API

# Testing automation RestAssurewd BDD Framework : gerkhen language 
API Testing Framework Summary (REST Assured + BDD)

This project automates testing for an e-commerce API using REST Assured, Java, and Cucumber (BDD). The framework validates major flows including login, product creation, and order placement.

🔐 Login API

Purpose: Authenticate users and generate a token for subsequent requests.
Covers:

Successful and failed logins

Missing/invalid fields

Invalid email formats

Status code and response validation

👜 Add Product API

Purpose: Add a new product using a valid user token.
Covers:

Successful product creation

Invalid or missing fields

Incorrect data formats

Overlength and special character handling

Authorization validation

Response body checks

📦 Add Order API

Purpose: Create a customer order using an existing product ID.
Covers:

Successful order creation

Invalid or missing product IDs

Missing/invalid authentication

Payload validation

Status code and body verification

✔ Framework Highlights

BDD with Cucumber for readable Gherkin scenarios

REST Assured for request/response validation

Data-driven testing using Examples and external test data

Reusable utilities and DTOs for cleaner code

Chained E2E workflow:
